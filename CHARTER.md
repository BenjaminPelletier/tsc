### 1. Mission and Scope of the Project

a. The mission of the Project is to develop an open source, simple, secure and scalable interoperability between separate UAS Service Suppliers (USSs) or Providers of Services for Urban Air Mobility (PSU) to further safe and efficient drone and other aircraft operations and satisfy needs for Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM). The Project will strive to be inclusive of international variations in terminology for UTM and UAM like services when practical. 

b. The scope of the Project includes open collaborative development under the Project License (as defined herein) supporting the mission, including documentation, testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation or adoption of the open source project.

### 1. Technical Steering Committee

a. The Technical Steering Committee (the “TSC”) will be responsible for all technical oversight of the open source Project. 

b. The TSC voting members are initially the Project’s Committers. At the inception of the project, the Committers of the Project will be as set forth within the “CONTRIBUTING” file within the Project’s code repository, and initial membership shall be determined by the Governing Board. Subsequently, the TSC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the TSC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in the CONTRIBUTING file.  Any meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. Committers are Contributors who have been approved by the TSC to modify (“commit”) source code, documentation or other technical artifacts in a project’s repository; and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. A Contributor may become a Committer by a majority approval of the existing Committers. A Committer may be removed by a majority approval of the other existing Committers.

d. Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and Committer is open to anyone so long as they abide by the terms of this Charter. 

e. The TSC may (1) establish workflow procedures for the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create new roles, and publicly document any TSC roles, as it sees fit.

f. The TSC may elect a TSC Chair, who will preside over meetings of the TSC and will serve until their resignation or replacement by the TSC.
